## kinematics

The kinematic equations of motion describe a system without taking into consideration the forces or energies involved. Thus, we can rely entirely on geometry to derive them. A kinematic description of the system using the generalized coordinates, $\theta_a,\ \theta_b$ is trivial as it is just themselves and their derivatives by definition. This is also not as useful, since cartesian coordinates are needed to draw the system using a computer.

As we'll see, there will be one hell of a lot of sinsoidial functions, so we denote $\sin\theta_x$ and $\cos\theta_x$ as $s_x$ and $c_x$ for convenience.

The positions of the point masses can be derived using geometry:

$$
\begin{alignedat}{3}
x_a =& &s_al_a& \\
y_a =& -&c_al_a&  \\
x_b =& &s_al_a& + s_bl_b \\
\tag{3.1c} y_b =& -&c_al_a& -c_bl_b 
\end{alignedat}
$$

The velocities can then be derived by taking the derivative of the positions
with respect to time:

$$
\begin{alignedat}{3}
\dot{x_a} &= &c_al_a\dot{\theta_a}& \\
\dot{y_a} &= &s_al_a\dot{\theta_a}& \\
\dot{x_b} &= &c_al_a\dot{\theta_a}& + c_bl_b\dot{\theta_b} \\
\dot{y_b} &= &s_al_a\dot{\theta_a}& + s_bl_b\dot{\theta_b}
\end{alignedat}
$$

Taking the derivatives once more with respet to time, we get the accelerations:

$$
\begin{alignedat}{3}
\ddot{x_a} &= c_al_a\ddot{\theta_a} - s_al_a\dot{\theta_a}^2 \\
\ddot{y_a} &= s_al_a\ddot{\theta_a} + c_al_a\dot{\theta_a}^2 \\
\ddot{x_b} &= c_al_a\ddot{\theta_a} + c_bl_b\ddot{\theta_b} - s_al_a\dot{\theta_a}^2 - s_bl_b\dot{\theta_b}^2 \\
\ddot{y_b} &= s_al_a\ddot{\theta_a} + s_bl_b\ddot{\theta_b} + c_al_a\dot{\theta_a}^2 + c_bl_b\dot{\theta_b}^2
\end{alignedat}
$$
