## newtonian dynamics

The direct approach uses the kinematic description of the system coupled with
newton's second law, $F=ma$ to derive a set of equations that determine the
system's motion as a function of time.

As depicted in the diagram above, point mass $a$ is being acted on by the
tension from the massless rods connect it to the origin and $b$.

$$
\begin{alignedat}{3}
m_a\ddot{x_a} &= -&T_as_a& + T_bs_b \\
m_a\ddot{y_a} &= &T_ac_a& - T_bc_b - m_ag \\
m_b\ddot{x_b} &= -&T_bs_b&  \\
m_b\ddot{y_b} &= &T_bc_b& - m_bg
\end{alignedat}
$$

Now that we have a system of equations that describe the acceleration of the
system for a given state given the forces acting on the bodies in the system.
Next, we can combine the

After some heavy algebra (see appendix for details), we can solve for
$\ddot{\theta}$ using the equations for acceleration along with thosederived
from newton's second law. The final solution is:

$$
\begin{alignedat}{1}
0 &= 2(m_a + m_bs_{a-b}^2)l_a\ddot{\theta_a}
 +2m_bs_{a-b}c_{a-b}l_a\dot{\theta_a}^2
 +2m_bs_{a-b}l_b\dot{\theta_b}^2
 -((2m_a + m_b)s_a +m_bs_{a-2b})g\\
0 &= (m_a+m_bs_{a-b}^2)l_b\ddot{\theta_b}
  -(m_a + m_b)s_{a-b}l_a\dot{\theta_a}^2 
  -m_bs_{a-b}c_{a-b}l_b\dot{\theta_b}^2
  -(m_a + m_b)s_{a-b}c_ag 
\end{alignedat}
