## newtonian dynamics

The direct approach uses the kinematic description of the system coupled with
newton's second law, $F=ma$ to derive a set of equations that determine the
system's motion as a function of time.

> TODO: Insert diagram

As depicted in the diagram above, point mass $a$ is being acted on by the
tension from the massless rods connect it to the origin and $b$.

$$
\begin{alignedat}{3}
m_a\ddot{x_a} &= -&T_as_a& + T_bs_b \\
m_a\ddot{y_a} &= &T_ac_a& - T_bc_b - m_ag \\
m_b\ddot{x_b} &= -&T_bs_b&  \\
m_b\ddot{y_b} &= &T_bc_b& - m_bg
\end{alignedat}
$$

Now that we have a system of equations that describe the acceleration of the
system for a given state given the forces acting on the bodies in the system.
Next, we can combine the

After some heavy algebra (see appendix for details), we can solve for
$\ddot{\theta}$ using the equations for acceleration along with thosederived
from newton's second law. The final solution is:

$$
\begin{alignedat}{1}
\ddot{\theta_a} &= \frac{
  -g(2m_a + m_b)s_a -m_bgs_{a-2b} - 2s_{a-b}m_b(\dot{\theta_b}^2l_b + \dot{\theta_a}^2l_ac_{a-b})
}{
  l_a(2m_a + m_b - m_bc_{2a-2b})
} \\
\\
\ddot{\theta_b} &=
  \frac{(m_a + m_b)s_{a-b}l_a}{(m_a+m_bs_{a-b}^2)l_b}\dot{\theta_a}^2 
  +\frac{m_bs_{a-b}c_{a-b}}{m_a+m_bs_{a-b}^2}\dot{\theta_b}^2
  +\frac{(m_a + m_b)s_{a-b}c_ag}{(m_a+m_bs_{a-b}^2)l_b} 
\end{alignedat}
$$
