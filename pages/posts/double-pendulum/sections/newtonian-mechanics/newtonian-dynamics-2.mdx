Starting from the kinematic equations for acceleration and the equations derived
from newton's second law, this section will describe how to solve for the
generlized accelerations, $\ddot{\theta}$.

We'll start by manipulating the second law equations to eliminate the
internal forces:

1. Find the first equation of motion by substitution of $T_b$.

2. Find the seconds equation of motion by substitution of $T_a$ and $T_b$.

  <CartesianNewtonianEquation2/>

Now we have the following equations of motions that do depend on the internal forces.

Note that the equations still depend on the cartesian accelerations of the point
masses. Next, we will use the kinematic equations for acceleration to solve
these equations for the generalized accelerations $\ddot{\theta}$. To make this easier, let
$s_x=s_x$ and $c_x=c_x$.
