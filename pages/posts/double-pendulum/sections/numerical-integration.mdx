### Stepping forward through time using the Euler Method

The equations of motion are a set of differential equations,
meaning that they describe a set of functions, each function
representing one possible trajectory of states the system
could take. Solving a differential equation for a particular
function given an initial condition is called an initial value
problem. The initial value problems of ordinary differential
equations that stem from physical systems often do not have
analytic solutions. Instead we can use numerical integration
methods to approximate the solution.

Covering all of the types numerical integration methods is
outside the scope of this post, instead we will focus on a
very simple method called the Euler integration method, or
Euler method for short. This method is not the best, but it
is easy to implement and can work well enough for simulations
that don't require much accuracy as long as the time step is
kept very small.
