<!-- 
## system -->

The state of the system at a given time can be described by two variables.

Here, we've
chosen the angle between vertical and each link, $\theta_a$ and $\theta_b$.
<!-- The simplest double pendulum variant we can model consists of two coplanar point
masses connected via massless links. When including gravity the system  will
display chaotic behavior (without gravity, you'll get trajectories similar to
something drawn by a [Spirograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph)).
Here is an illustration of the system, along with a table of variable descriptions: -->

|  |  |
|---|--|
| $o$ | the origin |
| $a,\ b$ | point masses |
| $m_a,\ m_b$ | masses of $a$ and $b$   |
| $l_a,\ l_b$ | link lengths, $\overrightarrow {oa}$ and $\overrightarrow{ob}$ |
| $\theta_a,\ \theta_b \in [-\pi, \pi] \hspace{10pt}$ | angle between vertical and each link |
