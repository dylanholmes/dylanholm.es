<!-- ## Formalizing a double pendulum -->


## How do we represent a double pendulum mathematically?

<!-- Before simulating any system, you first need a formal mathematical definition. -->

<!-- There are many choices on how to model a double pendulum.

__**How many spatial degrees of freedom the system have?**__  
  Here we've chosen 2D, but there is no reason you can't have it be in 3D or even 4D.
  With more than 2 dimensions, you have additional choices about how many degrees of
  freedom are selected for each joint.

__**How is the mass distributed?**__  
(e.g. in the links or joints?)

__**Are there any external forces acting on the system?**__   
(e.g. gravity)

__**Which variables are allowed to change over time?**__  
By definition, the joint angles connecting the links must be able to change
over time in order to be a double pendulum, but in theory, any of the other
parameters could change too. For example, the mass distribution, or the
link lengths.  -->

<!-- To keep this example simple, we've chosen to model the system as two coplanar point
masses connected via massless links. -->
<!-- 
## system -->

The state of a double pendulum at a given time can be described by two variables.
Here, we've chosen the angle between vertical and each link, $\theta_a$ and $\theta_b$.
<!-- The simplest double pendulum variant we can model consists of two coplanar point
masses connected via massless links. When including gravity the system  will
display chaotic behavior (without gravity, you'll get trajectories similar to
something drawn by a [Spirograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph)).
Here is an illustration of the system, along with a table of variable descriptions: -->
