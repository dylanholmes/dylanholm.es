### learnings

Here are some things I learned while making this article:

- The term "equations of motion" aren't just reserved for for dynamics. Any set
of equations that describe motion are "equations of motion" (quite obvious in
retrospect). So, when talking about "kinematic equations of motions" or "dynamic
equations of motion", you can simply say "kinematics" or "dynamics".
- In the blog post(link), I was surprised to see the author suggest using a
computer algebra program to solve the equations rather than solving them by
hand. While my first reaction was "what a cheater!", I realized this is a
actually a really smart decision to save time when you don't feel like ... I
still think you should try to solve equations by hand as a first choice, but
using a computer algebra program to just validate your answers or to let you
use your time more wisely is a great idea (well at least outside of education).
- Choosing the generalized the planar double pendulum as the angle between each
point mass and vertical was not my first choice when I started this article. I
started with $\theta_b$ being the angle between the vectors
$\overrightarrow{oa}$ and $\overrightarrow{ob}$, being more similar to recursive
kinematic descriptions used in most graphics software. I quickly found that the
math is slightly more complex with this choice (try it yourself), and so I
decided to keep with the common choice used in this article.

### Mechanics vs Dynamics vs Kinematics vs ...
from https://www.quora.com/What-is-difference-between-mechanics-and-dynamics: 

Mechanics deals with all interactions between the body with forces, and the resultant motion of the body. It's aim is to predict the nature of motion and rest under the action of forces.

Mechanics is broader area of study, comprising of Dynamics and statics.

Statics deals with bodies under rest or uniform motion ,i.e., equilibrium. The net force acting on the body will be zero.

Dynamics deals with moving (accelerating) bodies and the forces acting on them. Dynamics is again classified as

- Kinematics, which deals with the motion (displacement, velocity, acceleration) alone, without taking into consideration, the forces responsible for the motion.

- Kinetics which deals with the actual forces that are causing the motion. This mainly uses the d'alembert's principle.(F=ma)



### Timeline of the Reformulations ofClassical Mechanics 

#### 1687 - Newton's laws of motion
- Newtonian Mechanics
- vectorial mechanics (in contrast to Analytical mechanics)
- point masses

#### 1742 D'Alembert's principle
- Statement of the fundemental classical laws of motion
- more general than Hamilton's principle as it is not restricted to holonomic constraints that depend only on coordinates and time but not on velocities

#### 1740-1751 - Euler's laws of motion
- Does not get a special name like Foo Mechanics
- vectorial mechanics (in contrast to Analytical mechanics)
- Extended Newtonian Mechanics for point masses to rigid bodies

#### 1750's
- Euler-Lagrange equations?

#### 1788 - Lagrange's equations of motion
- Commonly called Lagrangian Mechanics
- A type of Analytical mechanics (in contrast to vectorial mechanics)

#### 1829 - Gauss's Principle of least constraint
- (Variational formulation of classical mechanics)

#### 1821 to 1835 - Hamiltonian Mechanics
#### 1821 to 1835 - Hamilton–Jacobi equation?

#### Late 1800's? - Routhian mechanics
- Combines Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics to get full advantages with additional convenience.

### 1879 and 1990 Gibbs–Appell equation of motion
- Equivalent to all other formulations of classical mechanics.
- Can be more convenient that the commonly used Lagrangian mechanics, particularly when nonholonomic constraints are involved
- Is an application of Gauss' principle of least constraint.

#### 1931 to 1932 Koopman–von Neumann mechanics
- Equivalent to all other formulations of classical mechanics.
- Classical mechanics in terms of hilbert space
