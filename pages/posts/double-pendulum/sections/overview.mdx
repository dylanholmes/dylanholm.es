## overview

The double pendulum is a beautiful example of a dynamical system. Despite having
only two degrees of freedom, it displays sophisticatedly chaotic trajectories
that can leave you mesmerized for hours on end (or at least me). In this post,
we'll explore the mechanics of this system. -->

This is a double pendulum.

Despite being a simple system, it exhibits chaotic behavior.

Small changes in initial conditions result in large differences in subsequent states.
