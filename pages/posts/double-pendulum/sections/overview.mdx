## What is a double pendulum?


A double pendulum is a two-link chain with one end fixed in space.
<!-- 
## overview

The double pendulum is a beautiful example of a dynamical system. Despite having
only two degrees of freedom, it displays sophisticatedly chaotic trajectories
that can leave you mesmerized for hours on end (or at least me). In this post,
we'll explore the mechanics of this system. -->

Despite being a simple system, it exhibits chaotic behavior. In other words, small
changes in initial conditions result in large differences in subsequent states. This
is commonly known as the butterfly effect. 

<!-- This makes it a particularly good system to simulate. -->
