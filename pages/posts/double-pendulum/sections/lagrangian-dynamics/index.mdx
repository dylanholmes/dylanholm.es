## Deriving the Equations of Motion using Lagrangian Mechanics

Before we go on to use the equations of motion derived in the last section,
let's visit one other approach to deriving the equations of motion, because
why not.

The Lagrangian approach differs from the Newtownian approach in that it
derives the equations of motion from energies rather than forces. This is
somewhat less general, in that it cannot handle non-conservative systems
(e.g. systems with friction), however it can be more convenient if applicable.
The cornerstone of Lagrangian dynamics is the Lagrangian, $L$, defined as the
difference between the kinetic energy, $E_k$, and potential energy of the system.

We will be able to derive the equations of motion from the Euler-Lagrange equation
for each point mass.

<Equation1/>

To compute the langrangian, first we need to find the potential energy, $E_p$:

<Equation2/>

And the kinetic energy, $E_k$:

<Equation3/>

Lagrangian becomes:

<Equation4/>

Compute the first term of the Euler-Lagrange equation for point mass $a$.

<Equation5/>
<Equation6/>

Compute the second term of the Euler-Lagrange equation for point mass $a$.

<Equation7/>

Combine the terms of the Euler-Lagrange equation for point mass $a$ to get the
first equation of motion.

<Equation8/>

Compute the first term of the Euler-Lagrange equation for point mass $b$.

<Equation9/>
<Equation10/>

Compute the second term of the Euler-Lagrange equation for point mass $b$.

<Equation11/>

Combine the terms of the Euler-Lagrange equation for point mass $b$ to get the
second equation of motion.

<Equation12/>

Eliminate $\ddot{\theta}_b$ from the first Lagrange equation to solve for
$\ddot{\theta}_a$. We'll end up with the same result as with the newtonian
approach (as expected).

<Equation13/>

Similarly, eliminate $\ddot{\theta}_a$ from the first Lagrange equation to solve
for $\ddot{\theta}_b$.

<Equation14/>

Now once again we have the equations of motion for the model.

<Equation15/>
