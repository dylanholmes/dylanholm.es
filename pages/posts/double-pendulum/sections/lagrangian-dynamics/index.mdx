## lagrangian mechanics

The Lagrangian approach differs from the Newtownian approach in that it
derives the equations of motion from energies rather than forces. This is
somewhat less general, in that it cannot handle non-conservative systems
(e.g. systems with friction), however it can be more convenient if applicable.
The cornerstone of Lagrangian dynamics is the Lagrangian, $L$, defined as the difference between the kinetic energy, $E_k$, and potential energy of the system.

<Equation1/>

To compute the langrangian, first we need to find the potential energy, $E_p$:

<Equation2/>

And the kinetic energy, $E_k$:

<Equation3/>

Lagrangian becomes:

<Equation4/>

Since we are using generalized coordinates all the constraints of the system
are modelled implicitly and we can use Lagrange's equations of the second kind
to .....

First equation!

<Equation5/>
<Equation6/>
<Equation7/>
<Equation8/>


Second Equation!

<Equation9/>

<Equation10/>

<Equation11/>


<Equation12/>


Eliminate $\ddot{\theta}_b$ from the first Lagrange equation to solve for
$\ddot{\theta}_a$. We'll end up with the same result as with the newtonian
approach (as expected).

<Equation13/>


Similarly, eliminate $\ddot{\theta}_a$ from the first Lagrange equation to solve
for $\ddot{\theta}_b$.

<Equation14/>
