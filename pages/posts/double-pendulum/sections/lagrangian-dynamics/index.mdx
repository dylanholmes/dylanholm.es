## Deriving the Equations of Motion using Lagrangian Mechanics

Before we go on to use the equations of motion derived in the previous section,
let's visit one other approach to deriving the equations of motion, because
it will allow us to check our work. If we arrive at a different set of equations,
then we know we made a mistake in one of the derivations.

The Lagrangian approach differs from the Newtownian approach in that it
derives the equations of motion from energies rather than forces. This is
somewhat less general, in that it cannot handle non-conservative systems
(e.g. systems with friction), however it can be more convenient if applicable.
The cornerstone of Lagrangian dynamics is the Lagrangian, $L$, defined as the
difference between the kinetic energy, $E_k$, and potential energy of the system.

We will be able to derive the equations of motion from the Euler-Lagrange equation
for each point mass.

<Equation1/>

To compute the langrangian, first we need to find the potential energy, $E_p$:

<Equation2/>

And the kinetic energy, $E_k$:

<Equation3/>

Form the lagrangian, $L$, using $\text{(24)}$ and $\text{(25)}$.

<Equation4/>

Compute the first term of the Euler-Lagrange equation $\text{(23)}$ for point mass $a$
by taking the partial derivate of $\text{(26)}$ w.r.t $\dot{\theta_a}$ followed by the
derivate w.r.t. time, $t$.

<Equation5/>
<Equation6/>

Compute the second term of the Euler-Lagrange equation $\text{(23)}$ for point mass $a$
by taking the partial derivative of $\text{(26)}$ w.r.t $\theta_a$.

<Equation7/>

Combine the $\text{(27)}$ and $\text{(28)}$ to form the the Euler-Lagrange equation
$\text{(23)}$ for point mass $a$, giving us the first equation of motion.

<Equation8/>

Compute the first term of the Euler-Lagrange equation $\text{(23)}$ for point mass $b$
as we already did for point mass $a$,
by taking the partial derivate of $\text{(26)}$ w.r.t $\dot{\theta_b}$ followed by the
derivate w.r.t. time, $t$.

<Equation9/>
<Equation10/>

Compute the second term of the Euler-Lagrange equation $\text{(23)}$ for point mass $b$
as we already did for point mass $a$,
by taking the partial derivative of $\text{(26)}$ w.r.t $\theta_b$.

<Equation11/>

Combine the terms of the Euler-Lagrange equation $\text{(23)}$ for point mass $b$ to get the
second equation of motion.

<Equation12/>

Eliminate $\ddot{\theta}_b$ from the first Lagrange equation to solve for
$\ddot{\theta}_a$. We'll end up with the same result as with the newtonian
approach (as expected).

<Equation13/>

Similarly, eliminate $\ddot{\theta}_a$ from the first Lagrange equation to solve
for $\ddot{\theta}_b$.

<Equation14/>

Now once again we have the equations of motion for the model.

<Equation15/>
