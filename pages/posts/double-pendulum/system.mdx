## system

Taking a first look at the system, we'll want to start with the simplest formulation possible; a planar double pendulum with point masses connected by rigid mass-less rods.

|---|--|
| $o$ | the origin |
| $a,\ b$ | point masses |
| $m_a,\ m_b$ | masses of $a$ and $b$   |
| $l_a,\ l_b$ | length of rods $\overrightarrow {oa}$ and $\overrightarrow{ob}$ |
| $\theta_b,\ \theta_b \in [-\pi, \pi] \hspace{10pt}$ | angle between vertical and $\overrightarrow {oa}$ or $\overrightarrow{ob}$ |
