## system

The simplest double pendulum system is planar, consisting of massless rods of
equal length connecting two point masses. Below is a diagram illustrating this
model.

As illustrated by the random motion imposed on the system $\theta_b, \theta_b \in [-\pi, \pi]$.

Point masses $a$ and $b$ are rigidly connected by a massless rod, as is $a$ to the origin,
$o$. $m_a$ and $m_b$ are the masses and $l_a$ and $l_b$ are rod lengths. The
full configuration can be described by two parameters $\theta_a$, the
counter-clockwise angle between vertical and $\overrightarrow{oa}$, and $\theta_b$, the
counter-clockwise angle between vertical and $\overrightarrow{ob}$.

There are, of course, other way of modeling the system, but this reduces some
algebra as you'll see in a moment.
