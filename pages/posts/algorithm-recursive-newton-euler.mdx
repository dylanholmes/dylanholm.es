## overview

The recursive newton euler algorithm is used to solve inverse dynamics of a
rigid body system that can be described by a kinematic tree. This algorithm was
first described in [[1]](#references-1), then later reworked to be simpler, more
efficient by utilizing a generalized coorderinate representation coupled with
spatial vector in [[2]](#references-2)

## background

We can represent any rigid body system in any configuration as the tuple $(\textit{model},\textit{state})$

Given a rigid body system comprised of $N_B$ bodies:

Let $\lambda(1)...\lambda(N_B)$ be the 


A rigid body system without closed-loops can be represented as a kinematic tree. One
way of describing such a system is by the number of bodies $N_B$, a parent body array
$\lambda(1) ...\lambda(N_B)$,.

The state, $\textit{state}$, is a set of generalized positions $\bm{q}$,
velocities $\bm{\dot{q}}$, and accelerations $\bm{\ddot{q}}$.

Inverse dynamics is the problem of finding the forces of a rigid body system given its state.

$$
\bm{\tau} = \text{ID}(\textit{model},\textit{state})
$$

## formulation

The model of the rigid body a $\textit{model}$ 



The general formuation of the algorithm is as follows:

1. Compute the velocity and acceleration of each body in the tree.
2. Compute the forces required to produce these accelerations.
3. Compute the forces transmitted across the joints from the forces acting on
the bodies.

&a_0 = -a_g \\
