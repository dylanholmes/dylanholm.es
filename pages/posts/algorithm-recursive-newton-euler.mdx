## overview

The recursive newton euler algorithm is used to compute inverse dynamics of a
rigidbody system which has a tree structure.

## background

Given a rigidbody system with a tree structure, defined as:
<BlockMath>
  {`
    \\text{Define the system here.}
  `}
</BlockMath>

Computing the inverse dynamics means the following:
<BlockMath>
  {`
    \\text{Define inverse dynamics here.}
  `}
</BlockMath>

## formulation

The general formuation of the algorithm is as follows:

1. Compute the velocity and acceleration of each body in the tree.
2. Compute the forces required to produce these accelerations.
3. Compute the forces transmitted across the joints from the forces acting on
the bodies.
