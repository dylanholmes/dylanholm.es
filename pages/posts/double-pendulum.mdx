## overview

In this post, we take a look at the phyics of a planar double pendulum. After
defining the details of the system under study using generalized coordinates, we'll derive the kinematics and
dynamics of the system from a newtonian perspective (using Newton's second law)
and from a lagrangian perspective (using the Euler-lagrange equations). As we'll
see, the dynamics of the planar double pendulum are non-linear and not directly
solveable with respect to time. ...

### learnings

Here are some things I learned while making this article:

- The term "equations of motion" aren't just reserved for for dynamics. Any set
of equations that describe motion are "equations of motion" (quite obvious in
retrospect). So, when talking about "kinematic equations of motions" or "dynamic
equations of motion", you can simply say "kinematics" or "dynamics".
- In the blog post(link), I was surprised to see the author suggest using a
computer algebra program to solve the equations rather than solving them by
hand. While my first reaction was "what a cheater!", I realized this is a
actually a really smart decision to save time when you don't feel like ... I
still think you should try to solve equations by hand as a first choice, but
using a computer algebra program to just validate your answers or to let you
use your time more wisely is a great idea (well at least outside of education).
- Choosing the generalized the planar double pendulum as the angle between each
point mass and vertical was not my first choice when I started this article. I
started with $\theta_b$ being the angle between the vectors
$\overrightarrow{oa}$ and $\overrightarrow{ob}$, being more similar to recursive
kinematic descriptions used in most graphics software. I quickly found that the
math is slightly more complex with this choice (try it yourself), and so I
decided to keep with the common choice used in this article.
